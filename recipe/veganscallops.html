    </h1>
    <img class="topphoto" src="../images/scallops.jpg" alt="image of vegan scallops">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Today Iâ€™m showing you how to make an easy vegan scallops recipe to impress vegan and non-vegan guests, or just cook them up for yourself for a fabulous dinner for one.

        This bite-sized appetizer has a delicate texture similar to a sea scallop and when marinated, they take on a full flavour that welcomes a fresh lemon sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>For the scallops</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large king oyster mushrooms, sliced 1-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable broth, hot</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white miso</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce or gluten-free tamari</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tsp seaweed or kelp granules</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the lemon butter sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp vegan butter</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>Sea salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For frying</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>vegetable oil, safe for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With a vegetable brush, remove any dirt or debris from mushrooms and slice off the woody ends and mushrooms caps. Save the caps to use for another recipe like a stirfry.</li>
        <li>Slice the stems into 1 inch (2.5 cm) long pieces.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl or Tupperware, whisk together hot vegetable broth, white miso, soy sauce or gluten-free tamari, kelp, and olive oil. Whisk until the miso has dissolved in the hot broth.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and marinate for 15 mins to 2 hrs. Overnight is preferred.</li>
        <li>After your mushrooms have marinated, melt 1 tbsp vegan butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, place marinated mushrooms, flat side down, and brown for 6-8 mins on each side. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
        <li>You can save time by making the garlic butter sauce in a seperate pan at the same time as frying the mushrooms, or save on dishes by using the same pan once all your mushrooms have cooked and are set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the garlic butter sauce, melt 2 tbsp vegan butter in the same skillet.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently for 1 minute, or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the lemon juice; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve mushroom scallops in a bowl or serving dish and pour the garlic butter sauce.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley.</li>
        <li>Enjoy as appetizer or add to a vegan creamy pasta dish</li>
    </ol>
